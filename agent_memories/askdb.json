The 'account' table has a 'create_time' column that tracks when users signed up\n3. The database appears to be using timestamps in UTC format\n4. When querying for time-based data like signups by month, I need to use date_trunc('month', create_time) for proper aggregation\n5. The database contains recent data from 2025 (July and August)\n6. For monthly comparisons, I should use extract(year from create_time) and extract(month from create_time) or date_trunc functions\n7. The account table likely contains user registration information that can be used for tracking signups and user growth metrics\n8. The database uses PostgreSQL syntax for queries",
